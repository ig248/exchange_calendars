A Python library for defining and querying calendars representing security exchanges.

Calendars for more than [50 exchanges](#Calendars) available out-the-box! If you can't find what you're looking for, [create a new calendar](#How-can-I-create-a-new-calendar).

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install exchange_calendars
```

## Quick Start

```python
import exchange_calendars as xcals
```

Get a list of available calendars:

```python
>>> xcals.get_calendar_names(include_aliases=False)[5:10]
['CMES', 'IEPA', 'XAMS', 'XASX', 'XBKK']
```

Get a calendar:

```python
>>> xnys = xcals.get_calendar("XNYS")  # New York Stock Exchange
>>> xhkg = xcals.get_calendar(
        "XHKG",
        start="2018-01",
        end="2021-12-31",
        side="left"
)  # Hong Kong Stock Exchange
```
Query the schedule:

```python
>>> xhkg.schedule.loc["2020-12-29":"2021-01-05"]
```
<!-- output from `xhkg.schedule.loc["2020-12-29":"2021-01-05"].to_html()` -->
<table border="1" class="dataframe">  <thead>    <tr style="text-align: right; font-size: 13px">      <th></th>      <th>market_open</th>      <th>break_start</th>      <th>break_end</th>      <th>market_close</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody style="text-align: right; font-size: 12px">    <tr>      <th>2020-12-29 00:00:00+00:00</th>      <td>2020-12-29 01:30:00</td>      <td>2020-12-29 04:00:00</td>      <td>2020-12-29 05:00:00</td>      <td>2020-12-29 08:00:00</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>2020-12-30 00:00:00+00:00</th>      <td>2020-12-30 01:30:00</td>      <td>2020-12-30 04:00:00</td>      <td>2020-12-30 05:00:00</td>      <td>2020-12-30 08:00:00</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>2020-12-31 00:00:00+00:00</th>      <td>2020-12-31 01:30:00</td>      <td>NaT</td>      <td>NaT</td>      <td>2020-12-31 04:00:00</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>2021-01-04 00:00:00+00:00</th>      <td>2021-01-04 01:30:00</td>      <td>2021-01-04 04:00:00</td>      <td>2021-01-04 05:00:00</td>      <td>2021-01-04 08:00:00</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>2021-01-05 00:00:00+00:00</th>      <td>2021-01-05 01:30:00</td>      <td>2021-01-05 04:00:00</td>      <td>2021-01-05 05:00:00</td>      <td>2021-01-05 08:00:00</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **How can I create a new calendar?**

First off, make sure the calendar you're after hasn't already been defined; exchange calendars comes with over [50 pre-defined calendars](#Calendars), including major security exchanges.

If you can't find what you're after, a custom calendar can be created as a subclass of [ExchangeCalendar]()<!--TODO ADD REFERENCE-->. The subclass should override those calendar-definition properties relevant to it. 

We're working on improving the documentation for creating calendars (contributions welcome!). In the meantime it's a (not too complicated) matter of referring to the `ExchangeCalendar` abstract properties' documentation and reading the comments in the code to ascertain which properties are relevant to the subclass and how they should be defined.

To access the new calendar via `get_calendar` call either `xcals.register_calendar` or `xcals.register_calendar_type` to register, respectively, a specific calendar instance or a calendar factory (i.e. the subclass).

### **Can I contribute a new calendar to exchange calendars?**

Yes please! The checklist [here](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars/issues/59#issuecomment-883284979) pretty much covers the process. (anyone with time to offer a PR more fully documentating 'How to contribute a new calendar', please do!)

### **`<calendar>` is missing a holiday, has a wrong time, should have a break etc...**

**All** of the exchange calendars are maintained by user contributions. If a calendar you care about needs revising, please open a PR - that's how this thing works!

### **What times are considered open and closed?**

`exchange_calendars` attempts to be broadly useful by considering an exchange to be open only during periods of regular trading. During any pre-trading, post-trading or auction period the exchange is treated as closed. An exchange is also treated as closed during any observed lunch break.

See the [minutes tutorial](docs/tutorials/minutes.ipynb) for a detailed explanation of which minutes an exchange is considered open over. If you previously used `trading_calendars`, or `exchange_calendars` prior to release 3.4, then this is the place to look for answers to questions of how the definition of trading minutes has changed over time (and is now stable and flexible!).
